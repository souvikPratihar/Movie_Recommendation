Movie Recommender System
This project is a content-based Movie Recommender System developed using Python. It recommends similar movies based on features like genres, overview, keywords, cast, and crew. The system uses CountVectorizer to convert text data into a matrix of token counts, and applies cosine similarity to measure how similar two movies are. This helps users discover movies with related content or themes, enhancing their viewing experience with intelligent suggestions.
